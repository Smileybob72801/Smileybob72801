   This book made algorithms finally *click* for me. It helped me visualize how to approach and solve problems algorithmically in a way that made sense.

- **Head First Design Patterns: Building Extensible and Maintainable Object-Oriented Software** by Eric Freeman  
   This book was a great introduction to design patterns, an intimidating subject to teach oneself. Having this book was like having a tutor that coud *see* how I needed to learn.
